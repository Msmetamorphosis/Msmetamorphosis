I thrive on challenges and excel in crafting creative, outside-the-box solutions that drive meaningful change.

  Over the years, I've continually expanded my skill set, always eager to exchange knowledge with others and learn new techniques. My ultimate goal is to be a driving force in building a company that not only prospers in the digital age but also makes a positive global impact. Currently, I’m open to full-time positions as well as opportunities within the 3 C's- Coaching, Consulting, and Contract work where I can effectively utilize my experience in AI, blockchain, and strategic development. I'm actively seeking opportunities where my combination of skills, experience, and proactive approach can add substantial value that is fairly and equitably reciprocated.
